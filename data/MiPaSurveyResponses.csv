The later was a common practice a decade ago (xx xx see Jones, plate, fig). Since WoRMS emerged that practice has been lost and not many researchers indicate their taxonomy but they refer to WoRMS straightaway, which I think it is not enough. 
It happens that or some taxa of benthic foraminifera WoRMS do not have an array of pictures, mostly one or two and quite often  they are not of good quality, or the best example. 
It is fair to indicate that WoRMS have links to the papers picturing the original descriptions (but not always). The access to those publications occurs through a request bottom and the paper will arrive to you email within the next two days or so. Thus, it is not inmediate
Therefore, I consider that linking names to pictures is desirable/essential to be able to reuse data (e.g. An user might decide to allocate a species according to their own jusfitied criteria).",ER,Benthic foraminifera,Europe
